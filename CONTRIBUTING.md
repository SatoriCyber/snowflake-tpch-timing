First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to this repo!
While the scope of this is very small, additional contribution can be done. A few examples: expanding the scope of queries to test (for example: adding TPC-DS or other sets of queries), adding additional database to test, or even running generated queries (for fuzzing or to disable caching).
